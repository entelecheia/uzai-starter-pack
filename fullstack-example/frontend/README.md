# Fullstack Example Frontend

The fullstack demo reuses the shared components from `frontend-template` but wires the API calls to the FastAPI backend located in `../backend`.

## Suggested Steps

1. Copy the contents of `frontend-template` into this directory or create a symlink during development.
2. Update the Axios endpoint to `http://localhost:8000/api/chat`.
3. Run `npm run dev` alongside the FastAPI server.
