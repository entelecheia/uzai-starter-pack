# Prompt Engineering Playbook

This module contains the exercises and reference material used to introduce new teammates to iterative prompt design.

## Files

- `chatbot_prompt_tuning.ipynb` — end-to-end walkthrough of designing customer-support prompts and logging evaluation metrics.
- `prompts/example_prompts.json` — seed prompts for the notebook walkthrough.
- `templates/system_message_template.md` — optional template for drafting system messages.

## Getting Started

1. Open the notebook in JupyterLab or VS Code.
2. Install the dependencies listed in the root `requirements.txt` or use an environment that already has `openai`, `python-dotenv`, and `ipykernel`.
3. Adjust the prompt JSON to reflect your product voice and run the evaluation cells.

## Next Steps

Continue with the RAG implementation sample to connect tuned prompts to grounded knowledge sources.
